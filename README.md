# Sorting-Algorithm
This a Sorting Algorithm Visualizer, to visualize the comparisons and swaps between values in an Array while being Sorted in Accending manner.

# Currently it has 6 of the sorting Algorithms implemented and I have plans to add more in the future if I get time.

# User can Input Array Size + Array Max Value and choose any Sort Algorithm and it will start sorting.

# The Array can be then Moved Up, Down, Left and Right with the arrow keys and the Scene can be Zoomed In and Out depending on the size.
